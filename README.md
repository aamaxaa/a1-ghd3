Design Achievement: In order to practice creating a cohesive piece, I decided I wanted to honor the planet documentary which feautre a forest at night. 
I created a little stick figure interactive art that move their arm when clicked. The drawing consists of a starry night featuring circular stars, tree shaped polygon, circular head, triangular mountains, and lines that make up the body of the figure</br>

The color choice and over all aesthetic of the drawing in quite pleasant to the eyes and emulate a starry night very well. The stick figure also sets up a very comedic sense to the dark drawing along with the bright outline of the tree. </br>

Technical Achievement: In order to implement an interative feature, I chose two portion. Firstly, the outline of the tree lights up yellow when it is hovered over. Secondly the stick figure's arms sway when the tree is clicked. </br>

The shape of the tree came from https://codepen.io/merlijn34/pen/ZOKRBZ. The tutorial of the other portion came from https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/d3js/create-svg-elements-in-d3js.
